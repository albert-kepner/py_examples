bot: Hello Al, how can I help?

user: Please show me a simple example of creating a small web app using python and flask.

bot: Sure! Below is a simple example of creating a small web application using Python and Flask. This web app will display a "Hello, World!" message when you access the root URL.

### Step 1: Install Flask
First, you need to install Flask. You can do this using pip:
```bash
pip install Flask
```

### Step 2: Create the Flask App

Create a new directory for your project, and inside that directory, create a file named `app.py`. Add the following code to `app.py`:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Step 3: Run the Flask App

Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where your `app.py` file is located, and run the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, Flask will start a development server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Step 4: Access the Web App

Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You should see the message "Hello, World!" displayed on the page.

That's it! You've created a simple web application using Python and Flask. You can expand this basic example by adding more routes, templates, and functionality to build a more complex web application.
