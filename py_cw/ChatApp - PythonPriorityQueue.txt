bot: Hello Al, how can I help?

user: How can I implement a priority queue in python and are there standard libraries to use instead?

bot: In Python, you can implement a priority queue using a few different approaches. The most common and efficient way is to use the `heapq` module, which provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm. Below are the steps and a sample implementation using `heapq`.

### Using `heapq` Module

The `heapq` module provides functions to maintain a heap, which is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Here's a basic example of how to use it:

```python
import heapq

# Create an empty priority queue
priority_queue = []

# Add items to the priority queue
# (priority, item)
heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (2, 'task2'))
heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (1, 'task1'))
heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (3, 'task3'))

# Pop items from the priority queue based on priority
while priority_queue:
    priority, task = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
    print(f"Processing {task} with priority {priority}")
```

### Explanation:
- `heapq.heappush(heap, item)` adds an item to the heap while maintaining the heap invariant.
- `heapq.heappop(heap)` pops and returns the smallest item from the heap, maintaining the heap invariant.

### Using `queue.PriorityQueue`

Another option is to use the `PriorityQueue` class from the `queue` module, which is especially useful when you need thread-safe priority queues.

```python
from queue import PriorityQueue

# Create a priority queue
pq = PriorityQueue()

# Add items to the priority queue
pq.put((2, 'task2'))
pq.put((1, 'task1'))
pq.put((3, 'task3'))

# Pop items from the priority queue based on priority
while not pq.empty():
    priority, task = pq.get()
    print(f"Processing {task} with priority {priority}")
```

### Explanation:
- `pq.put((priority, item))` adds an item to the priority queue.
- `pq.get()` removes and returns the lowest priority item from the queue.

### Custom Priority Queue

If you need a more customized priority queue, you can implement one using a class and the `heapq` module:

```python
import heapq

class CustomPriorityQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heap = []

    def push(self, priority, item):
        heapq.heappush(self.heap, (priority, item))

    def pop(self):
        return heapq.heappop(self.heap)

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.heap) == 0

# Example usage
pq = CustomPriorityQueue()
pq.push(2, 'task2')
pq.push(1, 'task1')
pq.push(3, 'task3')

while not pq.is_empty():
    priority, task = pq.pop()
    print(f"Processing {task} with priority {priority}")
```

### Summary
- For most use cases, the `heapq` module is sufficient and efficient.
- Use `queue.PriorityQueue` if you need a thread-safe priority queue.
- Implement a custom priority queue if you need additional functionality or customization.

These standard libraries and implementations should cover most needs for a priority queue in Python.
